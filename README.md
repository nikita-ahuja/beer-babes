<b>Beer Babes</b>


Beer Babes was my final capstone project while I was at Dev Bootcamp, that I completed alongside 3 teammates. It is a beer recommendation app that also cultivates a community for beer enthusiasts. If you peruse through the code, you will see that beer babes uses Ruby on Rails, AJAX, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to provide a platform that is efficient, dynamic, and intuitive. Connects with Google Maps API and pending keys from Untappd.

Simple to use, with Beer Babes, a user can create a secure profile, receive appropriate beer recommendations, and log notes and comments about the beers they have tried or would like to try. It is a fun and interactive application that is fully functional whether or not it has a large user base.


Currently, I'm working on redesigning the UI to be more elegant and intuitive for the user.
